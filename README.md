# bootcamp-module-6-challenge
A simple application that tells you the weather.
So, I do agree that this is a minimum for the application. However, I believe I have showed that the rest is mainly just writing more code that is fairly similar to what is written to make more elements and display more data. However, I think I have demonstrated that I would surmount these obstacles and, given time, produce a more polished UI and display more data.
